description,"Akari Therapeutics Plc is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, which engages in the development and commercialization of therapeutics to treat orphan autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The company is headquartered in New York City, New York and currently employs 13 full-time employees. The company is focused on the development and commercialization of treatments for a range of rare and orphan autoimmune and inflammatory diseases caused by dysregulation of complement component 5 (C5), including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, Guillain Barre syndrome and atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome. Its lead drug, Coversin, a complement inhibitor, acts on complement C5, preventing release of C5a and formation of C5b-9. Coversin is a recombinant small protein derived from a protein discovered in the saliva of the Ornithodoros moubata tick, where it modulates the host immune system to allow the parasite to feed without alerting the host to its presence or provoking an immune response. The company is conducting Phase Ib clinical trial of Coversin. The company focuses on rare and orphan diseases, including disease states spanning hematology, nephrology, transplantation, neurology and ophthalmology."
