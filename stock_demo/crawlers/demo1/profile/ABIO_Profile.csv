description,"ARCA biopharma, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company, which develops genetically targeted therapies for heart failure and other cardiovascular diseases. The company is headquartered in Westminster, Colorado and currently employs 15 full-time employees. The firm is principally focused on developing genetically-targeted therapies for cardiovascular diseases. The firm's lead product candidate is Gencaro (bucindolol hydrochloride), a beta-blocker and mild vasodilator that the Company is evaluating in a clinical trial for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFREF). Gencaro is considered part of the beta-blocker class of compounds because of its property of blocking both beta-1 and beta-2, receptors in the heart. The blocking of these receptors prevents the receptor from binding with other molecules, primarily the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE), which activate these receptors. The firm is conducting a Phase IIB/III clinical trial of Gencaro, known as GENETIC-AF."
