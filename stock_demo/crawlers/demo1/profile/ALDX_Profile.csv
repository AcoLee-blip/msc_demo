The firm's principal activities include raising capital and research and development activities. The firm's segment is the identification and development of a treatment for diseases related to high levels of aldehydes. The firm is focused on the development of products for diseases caused by inflammation and inborn errors of metabolism that are caused by naturally occurring toxic and pro-inflammatory chemical species known as aldehydes. The firm has developed a series of aldehyde traps, molecules that are designed to sequester and allow for the degradation of aldehydes. The firm's aldehyde trap, NS2, is a product candidate that is under development for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis and related rare allergic ocular diseases, noninfectious anterior uveitis, sjogren-larsson syndrome (SLS) and succinic semi-aldehyde dehydrogenase deficiency."
