description,"Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. engages in developing and commercializing peptide therapeutics for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases and genetic deficiencies. The company is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts and currently employs 54 full-time employees. The firm is focused on the development and commercialization of peptide therapeutics for the treatment of rare genetic deficiencies that result in life-threatening metabolic disorders. The Companyâ€™s lead peptide product candidate is setmelanotide, a potent, first-in-class melanocortin-4 receptor, or MC4R, agonist for the treatment of rare genetic disorders of obesity. Setmelanotide serves as replacement therapy for the treatment of melanocortin-4, or MC4, pathway deficiencies. MC4 pathway deficiencies result in the disruption of satiety signals and energy homeostasis in the body, which, in turn, leads to intense feelings of hunger and to obesity. The firm also focused on obesity related to six single gene-related, or monogenic, MC4 pathway deficiencies pro-opiomelanocortin, or POMC, leptin receptor, or LepR, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, Alstrom syndrome, POMC heterozygous, and POMC epigenetic disorders."
