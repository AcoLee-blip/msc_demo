description,"Trevena, Inc. engages in the development and commercialization of novel medicines for patients affected by central nervous system disorders. The company is headquartered in Chesterbrook, Pennsylvania and currently employs 29 full-time employees. The firm is developing OLINVO, a u-receptor G protein pathway selective modulator (u-GPS) for the management of moderate-to-severe acute pain where intravenous (IV) administration is preferred. The company is focused on commercializing it in the United States for use in acute care settings, such as hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers. The company is also developing TRV250, a G protein biased ligand targeting the o-receptor, as a compound with a non-narcotic mechanism for the treatment of migraine. TRV250 also may have utility in a range of other central nervous system (CNS) indications. The company is focused on commencing a Phase I study of TRV250 in the United Kingdom. Its ABLE product platform is a collection of biological information, in vitro assays, know-how and expertise that it uses to identify unique G protein coupled receptors (GPCR)-targeted biased ligands with various pharmaceutical properties."
