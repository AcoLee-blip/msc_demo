description,"ORIC Pharmaceuticals Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on improving patients’ lives by overcoming resistance in cancer. The Company is focused on developing a diverse pipeline of therapies designed to counter resistance mechanisms in cancer by leveraging its experience within three specific areas: hormone-dependent cancers, precision oncology, and key tumor dependencies. Its lead product candidate is ORIC-101. The Company’s ORIC-101 is a potent and selective small-molecule antagonist of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which has been linked to resistance to multiple classes of cancer therapeutics across a variety of solid tumors. The Company’s second product candidate, ORIC-533, is an orally bioavailable, potent and selective, small-molecule inhibitor of CD73, a key node in the adenosine pathway believed to play a central role in resistance to chemotherapy-and immunotherapy-based treatment regimens."
