description,"Daré Bioscience, Inc. operates as a healthcare company, which engages in the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products in women's reproductive health. The company is headquartered in San Diego, California and currently employs 19 full-time employees. The firm is focused on the development and commercialization of products in women’s reproductive health. Its lead product candidate is Ovaprene, a clinical stage, non-hormonal contraceptive ring. The firm is developing Ovaprene to provide protection over multiple weeks of use and require no intervention at the time of intercourse. Ovaprene has a custom intravaginal ring design, with a permeable mesh in the center of the ring that creates a partial barrier to sperm, and a mechanism to release locally acting spermiostatic agents through the ring. The combination of these two complementary approaches produces attractive contraceptive efficacy outcomes that are consistent with the effective barrier option, the diaphragm, and short-acting hormonal options, such as oral pill, patches and vaginal ring."
