The company is headquartered in Boulder, Colorado. The firm is engaged in discovering and developing ribonucleic acid (RNA)-targeted therapeutics with a specific focus on microRNAs and their role in diseases where there is a high unmet medical need. Its clinical product candidate for the treatment of certain cancers, MRG-106, is an inhibitor of microRNA-155 (miR-155), which is found at abnormally high levels in several blood cancers. The firm's clinical product candidate for the treatment of pathological fibrosis, MRG-201, is a replacement for miR-29, which is found at abnormally low levels in a range of pathological fibrotic conditions, including cardiac, renal, hepatic and pulmonary fibrosis, as well as systemic sclerosis. In addition to its clinical programs, it is involved in discovering and developing a pipeline of pre-clinical product candidates. Its pre-clinical product candidates include MRG-107 and MRG-110."
