description,"Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company, which engages in the research, development, and commercialization of novel therapeutics in treating chronic liver diseases. The company is headquartered in New York City, New York and currently employs 330 full-time employees. The firm is focused on the development and commercialization of therapeutics to treat non-viral, progressive liver diseases. The firm's product candidates have the potential to treat orphan and more prevalent diseases for which there are limited therapeutic solutions. The firm's product candidate, obeticholic acid (OCA), is a bile acid analog, a chemical substance that has a structure based on a naturally occurring human bile acid that selectively binds to and activates the farnesoid X receptor (FXR). In addition to OCA, it is developing other bile acid analog compounds targeting FXR and a second dedicated bile acid receptor called TGR5, which is a target of interest for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and other gastrointestinal indications. The firm is also developing other products INT-767 for the treatment of fibrosis and INT-777 for the treatment of type 2 diabetes."
