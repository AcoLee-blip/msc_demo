description,"Insignia Systems, Inc. engages in the provision of in-store advertising solutions. The company is headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota and currently employs 59 full-time employees. The firm's products include the Insignia Point-of-Purchase Services (POPS) in-store marketing program, thermal sign card supplies for the Company's Impulse Retail System, laser printable cardstock and label supplies, and The Like Machine. Its POPS program is an account-specific, shelf-edge advertising and promotion tactic. The program allows manufacturers to deliver product information to consumers at the point-of-purchase and to leverage the local retailer brand and store-specific prices to provide a call to action that draws attention to the featured brand and triggers a purchase decision. The company focuses on managing a retail network, made up of over 22,000 store locations, for the purpose of providing at-shelf market access for consumer packaged goods manufacturers' marketing programs."
