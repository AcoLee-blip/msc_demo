The firm is a pharmaceutical company focused on the development, manufacture and commercialization of pharmaceutical products, based on its DepoFoam extended release drug delivery technology, for use primarily in hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers.

In addition to EXPAREL, DepoFoam is also the basis for its other Food and Drug Administration-approved commercial product, DepoCyt(e), which it manufactures for its commercial partners, as well as its product candidates. The firm's other product candidates include DepoMeloxicam (DepoMLX) and DepoTranexamic Acid (DepoTXA)."
