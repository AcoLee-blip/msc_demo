description,"Celcuity, Inc. is cellular analysis company. The company is headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota and currently employs 26 full-time employees. The firm is focused on discovering new cancer sub-types and commercializing diagnostic tests designed to significantly improve the clinical outcomes of cancer patients treated with targeted therapies. The Company’s proprietary CELx diagnostic platform uses a patient’s living tumor cells to identify the specific abnormal cellular process driving a patient’s cancer and the targeted therapy that best treats it. CELx platform provides traditional molecular diagnostics, which provides a snapshot of the genetic mutations present in a patient’s tumor because they analyze dead cells. Using dead cells prevents molecular diagnostics from analyzing in real-time the dynamic cellular activities, known as cell signaling, that regulate cell proliferation or survival."
