description,"Novan, Inc. is a biotechnology company, which engages in leveraging nitric oxide's natural antiviral and immunomodulatory mechanisms of action to treat dermatological and oncovirus-mediated diseases. The company is headquartered in Morrisville, North Carolina and currently employs 48 full-time employees. The firm is focused on leveraging nitric oxide’s naturally occurring anti-microbial and immunomodulatory mechanisms of action to treat a range of diseases. The firm has created a Nitricil technology platform enabling the development of new chemical entities (NCEs) with delivery of nitric oxide. The Company’s two key components of its nitric oxide platform are its Nitricil technology, which drives the creation of NCEs, and its formulation science, both of which it uses to tune its product candidates for specific indications. Novan’s Nitricil technology enables it to store large amounts of nitric oxide gas in a stable, solid form by chemically loading it on a macromolecule, or polymer. The nitric oxide platform has produced a portfolio that includes the various clinical stage dermatology product candidates: SB204, SB206, SB208 and SB414."
