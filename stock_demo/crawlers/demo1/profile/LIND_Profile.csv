description,"Lindblad Expeditions Holdings, Inc. engages in the provision of expedition cruising and travel services. The company is headquartered in New York City, New York and currently employs 600 full-time employees. The firm provides expedition cruising and adventure travel experiences using itineraries that feature up-close encounters with wildlife, nature, history and culture. Its segments include Lindblad and Natural Habitat. As of December 31, 2016, the Company's expedition ships consisted of six owned vessels and five seasonal charter vessels. The firm's expeditions involve travel to remote places with limited infrastructure and ports (such as Antarctica and the Arctic), including places that are accessed by a ship (such as the Galapagos, Alaska, Baja's Sea of Cortez, Costa Rica, Cuba and Panama). In addition to its sea-based expeditions, the Company offers land-based, eco-conscious expeditions from Antarctica to Zambia primarily through its ownership of Natural Habitat, Inc. In the northern hemisphere summer months, the Company visits the High Arctic regions of the world, the Canadian Maritimes, Europe and Alaska."
