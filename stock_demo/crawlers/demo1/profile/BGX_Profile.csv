description,"Blackstone/GSO Long-Short Credit Income Fund is a diversified, closed-end management investment company. The Fund's investment objective is to provide current income, with a secondary objective of capital appreciation. It takes long positions in investments, which it believes will offer the potential for attractive returns under various economic and interest rate environments. It may also take short positions in investments, which it believes will under-perform due to a greater sensitivity to earnings growth of the issuer, default risk or the general level and direction of interest rates. It must hold no less than 70% of its managed assets in first- and second-lien secured floating rate loans, but may also invest in unsecured loans and high yield bonds. It invests in various sectors, including healthcare and pharmaceuticals; services business; construction and building; banking, and finance. GSO/Blackstone Debt Funds Management LLC serves as an investment advisor for the Fund."
