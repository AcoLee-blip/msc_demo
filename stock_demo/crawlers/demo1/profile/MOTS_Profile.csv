description,"Motus GI Holdings, Inc. is a medical technology company, which is dedicated to improving endoscopy outcomes and experiences. The company is headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and currently employs 44 full-time employees. The firm is developing Pure-Vu system that integrates with existing colonoscopes to cleanse poorly prepped colons during the colonoscopy procedure. The Pure-Vu system uses a precise mixture of water and air to loosen debris from the colon mucosa while simultaneously evacuating the bowel contents, clearing the way for the endoscopist to perform a high quality examination, even when the patient is not fully clean prior to their procedure. The Pure-Vu System also helps in the early detection and prevention of colorectal cancer and other diseases of the rectum and colon This device fits standard colonoscopes, allowing the physician to clean poorly-prepped colons in a safe and effective manner to gain clear visualization of the colon mucosa."
