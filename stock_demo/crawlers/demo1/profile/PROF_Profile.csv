description,"Profound Medical Corp. develops, manufactures and markets therapeutic platforms that combine real-time magnetic resonance imaging with directional and focused ultrasound technology for incision-free ablation of diseased tissue. The company is headquartered in Mississauga, Ontario. The firm is a medical device company focused on prostate cancer care. Its product consists of common electronic components, capital equipment and disposables. The firm is developing and commercializing a minimally invasive procedure for patients with prostate cancer, the Transurethral Ultrasound Ablation-PRO (TULSA-PRO) system. Its technology combines magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance and ultrasound energy to deliver thermal ablative therapy to the prostate gland delivered through the urethra. Its real-time, MRI guided ultrasound procedure (TULSA) ablates the whole prostate gland, from the inside out, in a single session. The company has completed a Phase l International Clinical Trial. The Phase I trial has demonstrated that magnetic resonance (MR)-guided TULSA provides treatment planning, real-time thermal dosimetry and control of prostate ablation to within approximately 1.3 millimeters."
