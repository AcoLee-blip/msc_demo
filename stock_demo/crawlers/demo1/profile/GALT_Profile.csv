description,"Galectin Therapeutics, Inc. is a biotechnology company, which engages in drug research and development to create new therapies for fibrotic disease, severe skin disease and cancer. The company is headquartered in Berkeley Lake, Georgia and currently employs 6 full-time employees. The firm's drug candidates are based on its method of targeting galectin proteins, which are mediators of biologic and pathologic functions. The company uses naturally occurring, readily-available plant materials as starting material in manufacturing processes to create complex carbohydrates with specific molecular weights and other pharmaceutical properties. The firm has two product candidates, GR-MD-02 and GM-CT-01. The firm's galectin-3 inhibitor is GR-MD-02. The firm is focusing on development of GR-MD-02 intended to be used in the treatment of liver fibrosis associated with fatty liver disease (NASH), moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and in cancer therapy in combination with immune-system modifying agent(s). GM-CT-01 is a compound that continues to be explored in preclinical studies."
