description,"Trillium Therapeutics Inc. is a clinical stage immuno-oncology company, which engages in the research and development of therapies for the treatment of cancer. The company is headquartered in Mississauga, Ontario and currently employs 60 full-time employees. The firm leads program, TTI-621, which is a SIRPaFc fusion protein that consists of the CD47-binding domain of human SIRPa linked to the Fc region of a human immunoglobulin (IgG1). The company is designed to act as a soluble decoy receptor, preventing CD47 from delivering its inhibitory (''do not eat'') signal. Neutralization of the inhibitory CD47 signal enables the activation of macrophage anti-tumor effects by pro-phagocytic (''eat'') signals. A Phase one clinical trial (NCT02663518) evaluating intravenous dosing of SIRPaFc in patients with cancer is ongoing, and a second Phase one trial evaluating direct intratumoral injections is underway in solid tumors and mycosis fungoides (NCT02890368). TTI-622 is an IgG4 SIRPaFc protein, which is primarily being developed for combination therapy. An IND filing is targeted for 2H/17."
