description,"Invesco Senior Income Trust is a diversified, closed-end management investment company. The Trust's investment objective is to provide a high level of current income, consistent with preservation of capital. The Trust invests primarily in a portfolio of interests in floating or variable senior loans to corporations, partnerships and other entities, which operate in a range of industries and geographic regions. It borrows money for investment purposes, which may create the opportunity for enhanced return, but also should be considered a speculative technique and may increase the Trust's volatility. It invests in various sectors, including electronics/electrical; business equipment and services; telecommunications; cable and satellite television; retailers (except food and drug); healthcare; chemicals and plastics; utilities, and lodging and casinos. Invesco Advisers, Inc. is the investment advisor of the Trust. Invesco Senior Secured Management, Inc. is the sub-advisor of the trust."
