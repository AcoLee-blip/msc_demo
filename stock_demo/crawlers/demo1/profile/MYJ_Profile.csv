description,"BlackRock MuniYield New Jersey Fund, Inc. (the Fund) is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company. The Fund's investment objective is to provide shareholders with as high a level of current income exempt from federal income taxes and New Jersey personal income tax as is consistent with its investment policies and prudent investment management. The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing at least 80% of its assets in municipal obligations exempt from federal income taxes (except that the interest may subject to the federal alternative minimum tax) and New Jersey personal income taxes. Under normal market conditions, the Fund invests primarily in long-term municipal obligations that are investment grade quality at the time of investment. The Fund may invest up to 20% of its total assets in securities rated below investment grade or deemed equivalent at the time of purchase.
