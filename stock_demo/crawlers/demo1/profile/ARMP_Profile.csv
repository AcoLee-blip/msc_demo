The firm is engaged in identifying, characterizing and developing naturally occurring bacteriophages with its collaboration partners in bacteriophage biology, synthetic biology and manufacturing, to develop second-generation bacteriophage products. The firm is engaged in developing these phage product candidates using a discovery and development platform, which is designed for identification, characterization and manufacturing of multiple phage therapies. Each product candidate combines several chosen phages, which target a specific disease-causing bacterial pathogen, such as staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) and clostridium difficile (C. difficile). Its product candidates are AB-SA01 and AB-PA01."
