description,"Nuveen New Jersey Municipal Value Fund (the Fund) is a diversified closed-end management investment company. The Fund seeks to provide current income exempt from both regular federal and designated state income taxes by investing in a portfolio of municipal obligations issued by state and local government authorities within a single state or certain United States territories. It invests at least 80% of its managed assets in municipal securities rated investment grade (Baa/BBB) at the time of investment, or, if they are unrated, are judged by the manager to be of comparable quality. It may invest up to 20% of managed assets in municipal securities that are not exempt from New Jersey state income taxes if the manager believes doing so would enhance the Fund's after-tax total returns. Its investment advisor is Nuveen Fund Advisors, LLC."
