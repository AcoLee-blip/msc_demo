description,"Oyster Point Pharma, Inc. engages in the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical therapies to treat ocular surface diseases. The company is headquartered in Princeton, New Jersey and currently employs 18 full-time employees. The firm is focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical therapies to treat ocular surface diseases. Its lead product candidate is OC-01 (varenicline), a selective nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist, which is being developed as a nasal spray to treat the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease (DED). OC-01â€™s is a mechanism of action, which is designed to re-establish tear film homeostasis by stimulating the trigeminal nerve, activating the TPP and stimulating the glands and cells responsible for natural tear film production. The company is sprayed into the anterior portion of the nasal cavity, and stimulates nAChRs located on the chemosensory endings of the trigeminal nerve resulting in cholinergic neurotransmission."
