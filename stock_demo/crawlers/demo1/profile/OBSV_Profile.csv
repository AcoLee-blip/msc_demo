description,"ObsEva SA engages in the research and development of therapeutic treatments for woman's reproductive health and pregnancy. The company is headquartered in Plan-Les-Ouates, Geneve and currently employs 45 full-time employees. The firm develops oral compounds to treat womenâ€™s reproductive health conditions from conception to birth. Its pipeline includes three product candidates: Linzagolix (OBE2109), an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist intended for the treatment of endometriosis (phase 2b of clinical trials) and uterine fibroids (phase 3 of clinical trials); Nolasiban (OBE001), an oral oxytocin receptor antagonist undergoing phase 3 of clinical trials, with the potential to inhibit uterine contractions at the time of embryo transfer, thereby enhancing embryo implantation during assisted reproductive technologies (ART), and OBE022, an oral and selective prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2a) receptor antagonist designed to control preterm labor (phase 2a of clinical trials)."
