description,"Helius Medical Technologies, Inc. is a neurotech company in the medical device industry that focuses on neurological wellness. The company is headquartered in Newtown, Pennsylvania and currently employs 25 full-time employees. The firm focuses on developing, licensing or acquiring non-invasive platform technologies that amplify the brain's ability to heal itself. The firm is engaged in the development of its product, the portable neuromodulation stimulator (PoNS) device. The device, when used in combination with physiotherapy, is designed to enhance the brain's ability to compensate for damage due to trauma or disease. The firm's PoNS device is designed to induce cranial nerve non-invasive neuromodulation through an increase in stimulation of the facial and trigeminal nerves, which innervate the tongue. The PoNS device is developed to deliver to the tongue a non-invasive neurostimulation, in a form that induces neuromodulation. The PoNS device is an electrical pulse generator that delivers controlled electrical stimulation to the tongue."
