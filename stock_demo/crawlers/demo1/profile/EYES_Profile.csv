description,"Second Sight Medical Products, Inc. engages in the development, manufacture, and marketing of implantable visual prosthetics. The company is headquartered in Sylmar, California and currently employs 123 full-time employees. The firm intends to develop Orion Visual Cortical Prosthesis which provides useful artificial vision to individuals who are blind due to various causes, including glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, optic nerve injury or disease or forms of cancer and trauma. Its product, The Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System (The Argus II) provides electrical stimulation of the retina to induce visual perception in blind individuals and helps in treating outer retinal degenerations, such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP). The Argus II System provides an artificial form of vision that differs from the vision of people with normal sight. The firm's Argus II System employs electrical stimulation to bypass degenerated photoreceptor cells and to stimulate remaining viable retinal cells thereby inducing visual perception in blind individuals."
