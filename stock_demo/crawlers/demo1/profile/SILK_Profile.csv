description,"Silk Road Medical, Inc. develops and manufactures medical devices to treat neurovascular diseases. The company is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California and currently employs 176 full-time employees. The firm has developed an approach for the treatment of carotid artery disease called transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR). The Company’s TCAR relies on two concepts - minimally invasive direct carotid access in the neck and high-rate blood flow reversal during the procedure to protect the brain - and combines the benefits of endovascular techniques with fundamental surgical principles. The Company’s ENROUTE Transcarotid Neuroprotection System (NPS) and ENROUTE Transcarotid Stent System are the products for use in TCAR. The ENROUTE Transcarotid Stent is indicated for use in High Surgical Risk patients and is designed to be used in conjunction with the ENROUTE NPS during the TCAR procedure. The ENROUTE Transcarotid NPS is a device used to access the common carotid artery and initiate high rate temporary blood flow reversal to protect the brain from stroke while delivering and implanting the ENROUTE Transcarotid Stent."
