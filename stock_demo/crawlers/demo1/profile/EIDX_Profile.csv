description,"Eidos Therapeutics, Inc. focuses on addressing the large and growing unmet need in diseases caused by transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis (ATTR). The company is headquartered in San Francisco, California and currently employs 40 full-time employees. The firm is focused on addressing the unmet need in diseases caused by transthyretin (TTR), amyloidosis (ATTR). The company focuses on treating the disease by targeting them at their collective source by stabilizing TTR. The Companyâ€™s product candidate, AG10, is an orally-administered small molecule designed to potently stabilize tetrameric TTR, thereby halting at its outset the series of molecular events that give rise to ATTR. AG10 binds and stabilizes TTR in the blood, preventing the formation of amyloid and halting progression of the disease."
