The company is headquartered in South San Francisco, California and currently employs 55 full-time employees. The firm is engaged in a novel class of T cell engagers that harness the power of the body’s immune system to treat patients suffering from cancer and other diseases. T cell engagers are engineered proteins that direct a patient’s own T cells to kill target cells that express specific proteins, or antigens, carried by the target cells. Using its proprietary Tri-specific T cell Activating Construct, or TriTAC, platform, the Company is developing a pipeline of T cell engagers, or TriTACs, initially focused on the treatment of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. Its TriTAC product candidate, HPN424, is focused on the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, or mCRPC."
