description,"PIMCO Municipal Income Fund III (the Fund) is a diversified, closed-end management investment company. The Fund's primary investment objective is to seek current income exempt from federal income tax. The Fund invests approximately 90% of its net assets (and over 80% of its net assets plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in municipal bonds that pay interest that is exempt from federal income tax. The Fund also seeks to be alternative minimum tax (AMT)-free by avoiding bonds generating interest that may subject individuals to the AMT. Pacific Investment Management Company LLC serves as the Fund's investment manager."
