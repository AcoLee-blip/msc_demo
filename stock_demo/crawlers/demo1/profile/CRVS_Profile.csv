The company is headquartered in Burlingame, California and currently employs 49 full-time employees. The firm is focused on the development and commercialization of immuno-oncology therapies. The firm is developing drugs and antibodies that block crucial immune checkpoints and reprogram immune T-cells. The firm has a pipeline of four immuno-oncology programs, three of which focus on the adenosine-cancer axis to modulate an immune response. The firm's lead product candidate, CPI-444, is an oral, small molecule antagonist of the A2A receptor for adenosine, an immune checkpoint. Its other products include adenosine production inhibitor (a monoclonal anti-CD73 antibody); adenosine A2B antagonist, and interleukin-2 (IL-2)-inducible T cell kinase (ITK) inhibitors. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had not generated any revenue."
