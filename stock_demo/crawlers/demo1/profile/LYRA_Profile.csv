description,"Lyra Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage therapeutics company focused on the development and commercialization of novel integrated drug and delivery solutions for the localized treatment of patients with ear, nose and throat (ENT) diseases. The Companyâ€™s product candidates, LYR-210 and LYR-220, are bioresorbable polymeric matrices designed to be administered in a non-invasive, in-office procedure and intended to deliver up to six months of continuous drug therapy to the sinonasal passages for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). LYR-210 is an anti-inflammatory implantable drug matrix based on its XTreo platform that is designed to locally elute mometasone furoate (MF) to the inflamed mucosal tissue for up to six months in surgically-naive CRS patients who fail medical management. It has developed LYR-220 for use in CRS patients who continue to require treatment to manage CRS symptoms despite having had sinus surgery."
