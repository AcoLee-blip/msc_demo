description,"Relmada Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company. The company is headquartered in New York City, New York and currently employs 6 full-time employees. The firm is engaged in developing a pipeline of drug candidates to treat chronic pain. Its product candidates include d-Methadone (dextromethadone, REL-1017), LevoCap ER (REL-1015), BuTab (REL-1028) and MepiGel (REL-1021). Its d-Methadone is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist being developed for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Its REL-1015 is an extended release, abuse deterrent formulation of the opioid analgesic levorphanol, which is pharmacologically differentiated from morphine, oxycodone and other opioids for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock and long-term opioid treatment. REL-1028 represents formulations of oral, modified release buprenorphine being developed for both chronic pain and opioid dependence indications. REL-1021 is a topical dosage form of the local anesthetic mepivacaine for the treatment of painful peripheral neuropathies."
