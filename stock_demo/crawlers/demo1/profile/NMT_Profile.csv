description,"Nuveen Massachusetts Quality Municipal Income Fund, formerly Nuveen Massachusetts Premium Income Municipal Fund, is a diversified, closed-end management investment company. The Fund seeks to provide current income exempt from both regular federal and designated state income taxes by investing primarily in a portfolio of municipal obligations issued by state and local government authorities within a single state or certain the United States territories. It seeks to provide attractive monthly tax-free income, portfolio diversification and attractive after tax total returns. The Fund invests at least 80% of its managed assets in securities rated, at the time of investment, investment grade (Baa/BBB or better by S&P, Moodyâ€™s, or Fitch) or, if they are unrated, are judged by the manager to be of comparable quality. It may invest up to 20% of its managed assets in municipal securities rated below investment quality. Nuveen Fund Advisors, LLC is the investment advisor of the Fund."
