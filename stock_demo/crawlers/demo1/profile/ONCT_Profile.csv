description,"Oncternal Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage oncology company, which develops a diverse pipeline of treatments for cancers with critically unmet medical need. The company is headquartered in San Diego, California and currently employs 6 full-time employees. The firm is focused on developing a pipeline of product candidates for the treatment of cancers. Its pipeline includes cirmtuzumab, TK-216 and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T). Its cirmtuzumab product candidate is an anti-receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) monoclonal antibody. Cirmtuzumab is in a Phase-I/II clinical trial in combination with ibrutinib for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). TK216 is a small-molecule compound designed to inhibit the biological activity of E26 transformation-specific (ETS) oncoproteins. TK216 is being evaluated in combination with vincristine in a Phase-I clinical trial in patients with relapsed or refractory Ewing sarcoma. Its CAR-T product candidate targets ROR-1 and is in preclinical development as a treatment for hematologic cancers and solid tumors."
