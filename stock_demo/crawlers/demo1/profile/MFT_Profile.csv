description,"BlackRock MuniYield Investment Quality Fund (MFT) is a closed-end management investment company. The Company's investment objective is to provide shareholders with as high a level of current income exempt from federal income taxes as is consistent with its investment policies and prudent investment management. It seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing at least 80% of its assets in municipal obligations exempt from federal income taxes (except that the interest may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax). Under normal market conditions, it invests primarily in long-term municipal obligations that are investment grade quality at the time of investment. It may invest directly in such securities or synthetically through the use of derivatives. It invests in various sectors, such as transportation, utilities, county/city/special district/school district, health, state, education, housing, corporate and tobacco. BlackRock Advisors, LLC is the fund manager."
