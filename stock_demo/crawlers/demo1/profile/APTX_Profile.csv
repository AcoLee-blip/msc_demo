description,"Aptinyx Inc. is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company. The company is headquartered in Evanston, Illinois and currently employs 63 full-time employees. The firm discovers and develops therapies for disorders of the brain and nervous system. The firm has a platform for discovering compounds that work through a mechanism, which includes modulation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor to develop pathways involved with nerve cell communication. The firm's compounds are effective on disease models including, depression, neuropathic pain, migraine, traumatic brain injury and age-induced learning impairment. The firm's compounds facilitate receptor activation without over-activating the receptor. The Company’s lead product candidate is NYX-2925, a treatment for the painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy.
