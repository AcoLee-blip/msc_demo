description,"Tyme Technologies, Inc. is a biotechnology company, which engages in the development and commercialization of cancer therapies. The company is headquartered in New York City, New York and currently employs 15 full-time employees. The firm is focused on developing cancer therapeutics that is intended to be broadly effective across tumor types and have low toxicity profiles. The Company’s therapeutic approach is designed to take advantage of a cancer cell’s innate metabolic weaknesses to compromise its defenses, leading to cell death through oxidative stress and exposure to the body’s natural immune system. The Company’s lead clinical program, SM-88, is a first-in-class combination therapy in Phase II development for prostate cancer, and it is preparing to initiate an additional Phase II clinical trial for pancreatic cancer. The firm provides a novel compound for physicians to use in a treatment regimen for patients fighting six major cancers including breast, lung, prostate, gastric, esophageal and pancreatic cancers."
