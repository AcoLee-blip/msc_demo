description,"BioNano Genomics, Inc. is a life sciences instrumentation company, which focuses on genome analysis space. The company is headquartered in San Diego, California and currently employs 77 full-time employees. The firm develops and markets the Saphyr system. The Companyâ€™s products include Sequencing for Discovery Research and Cytogenetics. Sequencing alone, however, is significantly limited due to its inability to reveal structural variations. Cytogenetics provide a clinical diagnosis, cytogenetic tests detect known variations that are linked to specific diseases or therapeutic responses. Saphyr system is platform for ultra-sensitive and ultra-specific structural variation detection that enables researchers and clinicians to accelerate the search for new diagnostics and therapeutic targets and to streamline the study of changes in chromosomes, which is known as cytogenetics. Sequencing for Discovery Research is primarily used to find single nucleotide variations responsible for disease or therapeutic response."
