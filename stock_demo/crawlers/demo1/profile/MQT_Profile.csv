description,"BlackRock MuniYield Quality Fund II, Inc. (MQT) is a diversified, closed-end management investment company. The Fund's investment objective is to provide shareholders with as high a level of current income exempt from federal income taxes as is consistent with its investment policies and prudent investment management. The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing at least 80% of its assets in municipal bonds exempt from federal income taxes (except that the interest may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax). The Fund invests in municipal bonds which are in the three highest rating categories or, if unrated, of comparable quality at the time of investment. The Fund invests primarily in long-term municipal bonds with maturities of more than 10 years at the time of investment. The Fund may invest directly in such securities or synthetically through the use of derivatives. BlackRock Advisors, LLC is the investment manager of the Fund."
