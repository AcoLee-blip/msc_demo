description,"ENDRA Life Sciences, Inc. develops medical imaging technology. The company is headquartered in Ann Arbor, Michigan and currently employs 5 full-time employees. The firm's Nexus 128 system combines light-based thermoacoustics and ultrasound, to address the imaging needs of researchers studying disease models in pre-clinical applications. The firm is involved in developing Thermo Acoustic Enhanced Ultrasound (TAEUS) for incorporation into new ultrasound systems. The TAEUS platform has capabilities and potential clinical applications, such as enabling ultrasound to distinguish fat from lean tissue; enabling traditional ultrasound to visualize changes in tissue temperature, in real time; enabling ultrasound to view blood vessels from any angle, using only a saline solution contrasting agent, unlike Doppler ultrasound which requires precise viewing angles, and enabling ultrasound to image blood flow at the capillary level in a region, organ or tissue."
