The company is headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts and currently employs 637 full-time employees. The firm is engaged in developing and commercializing medicines to treat central nervous system (CNS) disorders. The firm's lead product candidate, SAGE-547 is an intravenous formulation of allopregnanolone, a neurosteroid that acts as a synaptic and extrasynaptic modulator of the Gamma-Amino Butyric Acid-A (GABAA) receptor.

The firm is focused on developing drugs based on selective allosteric modulation of CNS synaptic and extrasynaptic receptors.
