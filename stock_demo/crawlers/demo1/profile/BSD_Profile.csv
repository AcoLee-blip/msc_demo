description,"Blackrock Strategic Municipal Trust (the Trust) is a diversified closed-end management investment company. The Trust's investment objective is to provide current income that is exempt from regular federal income tax and to invest in municipal bonds that over time will perform better than the broader municipal bond market. The Trust seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing, normally, over 80% of its assets in investments exempt from federal income taxes (except that the interest may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax). The Trust invests approximately 80% of its assets in investment grade quality securities at the time of investment, and primarily invests in municipal bonds with long-term maturities in order to maintain a weighted average maturity of over 15 years or more. It invests in various sectors, such as transportation, health, education, corporate, tobacco, utilities and others. Its investment advisor and manager is BlackRock Advisors, LLC."
