description,"Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals, Inc. engages in discovery and development of a novel class of therapeutics using its proprietary small molecule nucleic acid hybrid (SMNH) chemistry platform. The company is headquartered in Hopkinton, Massachusetts and currently employs 29 full-time employees. The firm is engaged in the discovery and development of a class of therapeutics using its small molecule nucleic acid hybrid (SMNH) chemistry platform. The firm is developing its SMNH product, SB 9200, for the treatment of viral diseases. The firm's SB 9200 selectively activates within infected cells the cellular proteins retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) to inhibit viral replication and to cause the induction of intracellular interferon signaling pathways for antiviral defense. The firm is also developing a second SMNH product candidate, SB 11285, as an immunotherapeutic agent for the treatment of selected cancers through the activation of the STimulator of INterferon Genes (STING) pathway. The firm focuses on developing SB 9200 for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)."
