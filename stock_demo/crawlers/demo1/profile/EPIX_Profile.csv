description,"ESSA Pharma, Inc. engages in the development of small molecule drugs for prostate cancer. The company is headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia and currently employs 11 full-time employees. The firm is focused on developing therapies for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). The company is developing EPI-7386 for the treatment of metastatic CRPC (mCRPC). The company is also developing EPI-7386 combination therapy for mCRPC. Its pipeline also includes antinen for triple negative androgen receptor (AR+) breast cancer. Its proprietary aniten compounds bind to the N-terminal domain of the androgen receptor (AR), inhibiting ARdriven transcription and the AR signaling pathway in a manner which bypasses the drug resistance mechanisms associated with current anti-androgens."
