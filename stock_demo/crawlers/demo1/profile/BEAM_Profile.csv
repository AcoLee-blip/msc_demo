description,"Beam Therapeutics Inc. is a biotechnology company focused on developing precision genetic medicines based on its base editing technology, to providing life-long cures to patients suffering from diseases. Its base editing technology enables a new class of precision genetic medicines that targets a single base in the genome without making a double-stranded break in the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). It is advancing a broad, diversified portfolio of 12 base editing programs against distinct editing targets. Its programs are organized by delivery modality into three distinct pipelines: electroporation for delivery to blood cells and immune cells; lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), for non-viral in vivo delivery to the liver and potentially other organs in the future; and adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV), for viral delivery to the eye and central nervous system (CNS)."
