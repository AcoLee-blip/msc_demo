The firm's da Vinci Surgical System consists of a surgeon's console, a patient-side cart and a vision system.

The da Vinci Surgical System provides its operating surgeons with control, range of motion, tissue manipulation capability and three-dimensional (3-D), high-definition (HD) vision. Intuitive has four generations of da Vinci Surgical System: the da Vinci Xi Surgical System, the da Vinci Si Surgical System, the da Vinci S Surgical System and the standard da Vinci Surgical System. The firm's instruments and accessories include EndoWrist Instruments and da Vinci Single-Site."
