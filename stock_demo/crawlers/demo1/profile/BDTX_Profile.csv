description,"Black Diamond Therapeutics, Inc. is a precision oncology medicine company. The Companyâ€™s technology platform, Mutation-Allostery-Pharmacology (MAP) platform is designed to allow it to analyze population-level genetic sequencing data to identify oncogenic mutations that promote cancer across tumor types, group these mutations into families and develop a single small molecule therapy in a tumor-agnostic manner that targets a specific family of mutations. The Company has designed its lead product candidate, BDTX-189, to block the function of an undrugged family of oncogenic proteins defined by mutations which occur across a range of tumor types, and which affect both the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the tyrosine-protein kinase ErbB-2, or HER2."
