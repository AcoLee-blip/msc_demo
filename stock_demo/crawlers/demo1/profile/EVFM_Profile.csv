description,"Evofem Biosciences, Inc. develops therapeutic solutions to meet sexual and reproductive health needs of women. The company is headquartered in San Diego, California and currently employs 30 full-time employees. The firm develops products to address unmet needs in women's sexual and reproductive health. The Companyâ€™s product Amphora, is a Multipurpose Vaginal pH Regulator (MVP-R) designed to regulate vaginal pH to within the normal range of 3.5 to 4.5 even in the presence of semen. This maintains an acidic environment which is inhospitable to sperm as well as certain viral and bacterial pathogens associated with sexually transmitted infections. Amphora is used to prevent urogenital chlamydia and gonorrhea in women. The firm is in the second Phase III clinical trial of Amphora for prevention of pregnancy (AMP002). The firm is currently designing a Phase IIb trial for its second product candidate, a MVP-R to reduce the recurrence of bacterial vaginosis."
