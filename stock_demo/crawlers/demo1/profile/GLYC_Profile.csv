The company is headquartered in Rockville, Maryland and currently employs 50 full-time employees. The firm focuses on the discovery and development of glycomimetic drugs. The firm operates through the identification and development of glycomimetic compounds segment. The firm is developing its lead drug candidate, GMI-1070 (Rivipansel), for the treatment of vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), a debilitating and painful condition that occurs periodically throughout the life of a person with sickle cell disease. The firm is developing GMI-1271, a specific E-selectin inhibitor, to be used in combination with chemotherapy to treat patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), multiple myeloma (MM) and other hematologic cancers.
