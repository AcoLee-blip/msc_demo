description,"Profire Energy, Inc. engages in the manufacture of burner-management systems used on a variety of oilfield forced-air and natural-draft fire-tube applications. The company is headquartered in Lindon, Utah and currently employs 103 full-time employees. The firm is primarily engaged in the business of developing combustion management technologies for the oil and gas industry. The company specializes in the creation of burner-management systems, used on a range of oilfield natural-draft fire tube vessels. The company offers burner-management systems, which help to ignite, monitor and manage the burner flame. Its solution, the PF3100, helps manage and synchronize custom applications helping oilfield producers meet deadlines through an off-the-shelf solution with dynamic customization. The company also sells complementary oilfield products. Such products help manage fuel flow (such as valves and fuel trains), meter air flow (such as airplates), generate power on-site (such as solar packages), ignite and direct flame (such as flare stack igniter and nozzles), and other functions. In addition to the burner-management systems and complementary technologies, it also offers chemical-management systems."
