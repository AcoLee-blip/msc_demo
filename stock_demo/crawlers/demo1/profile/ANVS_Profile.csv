The Company is focused on addressing neurodegeneration, such as Alzheimer's disease in Down syndrome (AD-DS), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The Company is engaged in developing drugs that normalize the transport of information within and between nerve cells, called axonal transport. Its lead product pipelines are ANVS-401, which include ANVS-401 for AD, ANVS-401 for AD-DS, ANVS-401 for PD; ANVS-405 and ANVS-301.
