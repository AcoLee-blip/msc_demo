description,"Monopar Therapeutics, Inc. is a a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company, which engages in building a drug development pipeline through the licensing and acquisition of oncology therapeutics in late preclinical and clinical development stages. The company is headquartered in Wilmette, Illinois and currently employs 5 full-time employees. The firm is focused on developing therapeutics for cancer patients. Its pipeline includes Validive, Camsirubicin and MNPR-101. Validive is a clonidine mucobuccal tablet (clonidine MBT). Validive is designed to be used prophylactically to reduce the incidence, delay the time to onset, and decrease the duration of severe oral mucositis in patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy for oropharyngeal cancer. Its second product candidate, Camsirubicin, is a novel analog of doxorubicin. Camsirubicin is designed to reduce the cardiotoxic side effects generated by doxorubicin while retaining anti-cancer activity. MNPR-101 is a humanized monoclonal antibody designed to bind a specific cell surface receptor found on cancer cells, the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), and to interrupt several pathways required for tumor growth and progression. The company is developing MNPR-101 for the treatment of advanced cancers."
