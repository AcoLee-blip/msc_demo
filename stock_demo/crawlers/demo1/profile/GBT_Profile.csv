description,"Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, which engages in the discovering, developing and commercializing novel therapeutics to treat grievous blood-based disorders. The company is headquartered in South San Francisco, California and currently employs 171 full-time employees. The firm is engaged in discovering, developing and commercializing therapeutics to treat blood-based disorders. The firm is developing its initial product candidate, GBT440, as an oral, once-daily therapy for sickle cell disease (SCD). The firm is evaluating GBT440 in SCD in a Phase III clinical trial of GBT440 in adult and adolescent patients with SCD. GBT440 inhibits abnormal hemoglobin polymerization, the underlying mechanism of RBC sickling. The firm is also engaged in other research and development activities targeted towards hereditary angioedema (HAE). The firm's GBT440 is an investigational drug that increases hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen by binding to the alpha-chain of hemoglobin. GBT440 has been observed to keep a proportion of sickle hemoglobin (HbS), in its oxygenated state, where it cannot participate in polymerization."
