description,"ClearSign Technologies Corp. engages in the design and development of technologies for the combustion systems. The company is headquartered in Tukwila, Washington and currently employs 16 full-time employees. The firm's Duplex and Electrodynamic Combustion Control (ECC) platform technologies manage the performance of combustion systems in a range of markets, including the energy (upstream oil production and down-stream refining), commercial/industrial boiler, chemical, petrochemical, and power industries. The firm's Duplex technology uses a porous ceramic tile above a standard burner to reduce flame length and achieve low emissions without the need for external flue gas recirculation, catalytic reduction, or air systems. The firm's ECC technology offers a computer-controlled voltage electric field into a combustion volume in order to control gas-phase chemical reactions and manage system performance."
