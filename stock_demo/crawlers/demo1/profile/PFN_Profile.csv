description,"PIMCO Income Strategy Fund II (the Fund) is a closed-end management investment company. The Fund's primary investment objective is to seek high current income, consistent with the preservation of capital. The Fund allocates assets in varying proportions among floating- and fixed-rate debt instruments, as well as among investment grade and non-investment-grade securities. The Fund will not invest more than 20% of its total assets in securities that are, at the time of purchase, rated CCC/Caa or below by each ratings agency rating the security, or that are unrated but judged by PIMCO to be of comparable quality. The Fund invests in a range of securities, such as corporate bonds and notes, non-agency mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, municipal bonds and notes, and short-term instruments. Pacific Investment Management Company LLC serves as the Funds' investment manager."
