description,"BioSpecifics Technologies Corp. engages in the development of an injectable collagenase clostridium histolyticum for multiple indications. The company is headquartered in Lynbrook, New York and currently employs 5 full-time employees. The firm has a development and license agreement with Endo Global Ventures, a Bermuda unlimited liability company (Endo Global Ventures), an affiliate of Endo International plc (Endo), for injectable collagenase for marketed indications and indications in development. Injectable collagenase clostridium histolyticum is marketed as XIAFLEX (or Xiapex in Europe). The two marketed indications involving its injectable collagenase are Dupuytren's contracture and Peyronie's disease. The other clinical indications for which its collagenase injection has been tested include keloids, hypertrophic scars, scarred tendons, glaucoma, herniated intervertebral discs, and as an adjunct to vitrectomy. The firm is evaluating its options for development of additional indications using collagenase."
