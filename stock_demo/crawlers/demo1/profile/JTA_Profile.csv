description,"Nuveen Tax Advantaged Total Return Strategy Fund (the Fund) is a diversified, closed-end investment company. The Fund's investment objective is to achieve a high level of after-tax total return consisting primarily of tax-advantaged dividend income and capital appreciation. It invests a substantial majority of its assets in common and preferred stocks whose dividends qualify for reduced income tax treatment. It also invests a portion of its assets in senior loans to generate additional income and help mitigate the potential net asset value and income volatility of the Fund's leverage structure due to changes in long-term and short-term interest rates. It invests at least 60% of its managed assets in dividend-paying common stocks. It also invests 15% to 25% in senior loans and other debt instruments, as well as 5% to 15% in preferred stocks that are eligible to pay tax-advantaged dividends. The Fund's investment advisor is Nuveen Fund Advisors, LLC."
