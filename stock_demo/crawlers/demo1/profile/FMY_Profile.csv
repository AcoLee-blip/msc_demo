description,"First Trust Mortgage Income Fund is a diversified, closed-end management investment company. The Fund's primary investment objective is to seek a high level of current income. As a secondary objective, it seeks to preserve capital. The Fund pursues its objectives by investing primarily in mortgage-backed securities that offer a combination of credit quality, yield and maturity. Its investment portfolio includes the United States Government securities, mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and other asset-backed securities. A portion of its managed assets may be invested in subordinated classes of MBS, including debt obligations issued by private originators or issuers backed by residential mortgage loans and multi-class debt or pass-through or pay-through securities backed by a mortgage loan or pool of mortgage loans on commercial real estate. First Trust Advisors L.P. is the investment advisor and Brookfield Investment Management Inc. is the investment sub-advisor of the Fund."
