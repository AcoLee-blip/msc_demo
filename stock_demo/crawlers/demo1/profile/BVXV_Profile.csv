The company is developing the M-001 Universal Flu Vaccine. M-001 is undergoing a pivotal, clinical efficacy, Phase 3 trial in about 12,400 participants. M-001 is designed to provide multi-season and multi-strain protection against all human influenza virus strains, both seasonal and pandemic. In 6 completed clinical trials the vaccine was shown to be safe, well tolerated and immunogenic to a broad range of flu strains. The Companyâ€™s technology utilizes a proprietary combination of conserved and common peptides from influenza virus proteins to activate both arms of the immune system for a cross-protecting and long-lasting effect."
