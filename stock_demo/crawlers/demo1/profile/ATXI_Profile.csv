The company is headquartered in New York City, New York and currently employs 6 full-time employees. The firm is engaged in acquiring, licensing, developing and commercializing products principally for use in the acute or intensive care hospital setting. Its product candidate is intravenous (IV) Tramadol, an intravenous formulation of tramadol hydrochloride (HCl), for the management of moderate to moderately severe postoperative pain. Tramadol, a synthetic dual-acting opioid, is a centrally acting analgesic with weak opioid agonist properties. The company also works via the inhibition of serotonin and noradrenaline re-uptake and blocking nociceptive impulses at the spinal level. Tramadol is also combined with acetaminophen (APAP) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) in clinical practice. During the year ending December 31, 2016, the Company had completed a pharmacokinetics (PK) study for IV Tramadol in healthy volunteers."
