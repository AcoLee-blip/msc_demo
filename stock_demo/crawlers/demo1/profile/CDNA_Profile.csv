The company is headquartered in Brisbane California, California and currently employs 227 full-time employees. The firm is focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of clinically differentiated diagnostic surveillance solutions for transplant patients.

Its products under development for transplant monitoring include AlloSure, a development-stage transplant surveillance solution, which applies next generation sequencing to detect and quantitate genetic differences between donor-derived cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (dd-cfDNA) in the blood stream emanating from the donor heart. The company offers the AlloMap Score Variability service, which provides complementary information to help personalize long-term care of heart transplant recipients."
