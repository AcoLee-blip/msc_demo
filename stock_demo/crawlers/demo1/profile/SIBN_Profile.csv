The firm is engaged in the development, manufacture and commercialization of minimally invasive surgical devices for the treatment of patients with low back symptoms related to certain sacroiliac (SI) joint disorders. The firm offers iFuse Implant System, which provides a minimally invasive surgical solution to fuse the SI joint using patented triangular titanium implants that create an interference fit within the ilium and sacrum. The triangular implant shape, combined with the press fit insertion, is designed to provide fixation by minimizing rotational motion. The implants has a porous surface that provide an environment for bone ongrowth and ingrowth, facilitating long-term fusion of the joint. The iFuse Implant System is intended for sacroiliac fusion for conditions, including sacroiliac joint dysfunction that is a direct result of sacroiliac joint disruption and degenerative sacroiliitis."
