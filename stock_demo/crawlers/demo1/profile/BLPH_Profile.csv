description,"Bellerophon Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage therapeutics company. The Company is focused on developing products at the intersection of drugs and devices that address medical needs in the treatment of cardiopulmonary diseases. The Company is focused on the development of its nitric oxide therapy for patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH), using its delivery system, INOpulse, with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) as the lead indication. The Company's INOpulse device has a mechanism that delivers brief, targeted pulses of nitric oxide timed to occur at the beginning of a breath for delivery to the alveoli of the lungs, which minimizes the amount of drug required for treatment. INOpulse is designed to be compatible with many long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) systems via nasal cannula delivery."
