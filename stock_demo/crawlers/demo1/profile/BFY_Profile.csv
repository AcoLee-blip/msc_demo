description,"Blackrock New York Municipal Income Trust II is a perpetual closed-end municipal bond. The Trust's investment objective is to provide as high a level of current income exempt from both regular United States federal income taxes and Massachusetts personal income taxes as is consistent with the preservation of shareholders’ capital. It seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in Massachusetts tax-exempt obligations (including bonds, notes and capital lease obligations). It invests at least 80% of its assets in obligations that are rated investment grade at the time of investment or, if unrated, determined to be of comparable quality at the time of investment by the Trust’s investment adviser. It invests in various sectors, including county/city/special district/school district, transportation, education, utilities, health, state tax-backed, housing, corporate, local tax-backed and tobacco. BlackRock Advisors, LLC is the investment advisor of the Trust."
