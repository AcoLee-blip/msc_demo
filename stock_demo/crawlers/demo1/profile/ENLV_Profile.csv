description,"Enlivex Therapeutics Ltd. develops autologous and allogeneic drug pipeline for treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. The firm aims to develop and commercialize an allogeneic drug pipeline for rebalancing all manner of immune hyper-responses. The firm is developing Allocetra, a cell-based immunotherapy, for the treatment of numerous acute conditions. The company rebalances a life-threatening unbalanced immune system, using the immune system’s own natural regulation mechanisms. Allocetra is designed to avert cytokine storms and restores safe immune balance, without suppressing the immune system, by engaging macrophages and dendritic cells. The Company’s clinical development programs focus on preventing or treating complications associated with bone-marrow transplantations, Sepsis and solid tumors."
