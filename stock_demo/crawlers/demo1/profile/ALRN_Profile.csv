Its lead product candidate, ALRN-6924, targets the tumor suppressor protein p53 for the treatment of a range of cancers. The firm is conducting an ongoing Phase I clinical trial of ALRN-6924 in adult patients with solid tumors or lymphomas expressing non-mutated or wild-type p53 that are refractory to or intolerant of standard therapy. ALRN-6924 may reactivate p53-mediated cell death by targeting both of the natural p53 suppressor proteins, Mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) and MDMX."
