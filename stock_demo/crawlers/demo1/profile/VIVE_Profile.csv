description,"Viveve Medical, Inc. is a medical technology company focused on women's intimate health. The company is headquartered in Englewood, Colorado and currently employs 67 full-time employees. The Company's, Geneveve, is a non-invasive solution for vaginal laxity, which includes three components: the Viveve System (a radio frequency (RF), generator housed in a table-top console), a reusable handpiece and a single-use treatment tip, as well as several other consumable accessories. Physicians attach the single-use treatment tip to the handpiece, which is connected to the console. The generator authenticates the treatment tip and programs the system for the desired treatment without further physician intervention. The treatment is performed in a physician's office, in less than 30 minutes, and does not require the use of anesthesia. Geneveve is indicated for use in general surgical procedures for electrocoagulation and hemostasis in the United States."
