description,"Forward Pharma A/S is a biopharmaceutical company, which engages in the research and development of medicinal treatment for inflammatory and neurological indications. The firm is engaged in the development of FP187, a formulation of dimethyl fumarate (DMF) for the treatment of several inflammatory and neurological indications, including multiple sclerosis (MS). The firm's clinical candidate, FP187, is under development for the treatment of relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) and other immune disorders, such as psoriasis. The firm's DMF formulation, FP187, employs over two methods, which improves the release of DMF by reducing the peaks of monomethyl fumarate (MMF) in the bloodstream while maintaining overall DMF exposure levels, which, in turn, controls DMF's side effects. The firm has conducted a pre-clinical program and has completed several Phase I and Phase II clinical trials for the product FP187."
