description,"Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc. is an in vitro diagnostics company, which engages in the provision of solutions that improve patient outcomes and lower healthcare costs through the rapid diagnosis of serious infections. The company is headquartered in Tucson, Arizona and currently employs 287 full-time employees. The firm's in vitro diagnostic platform, the Accelerate Pheno system utilizes genotypic technology to identify (ID), infectious pathogens and phenotypic technology to conduct antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST), which determines whether live bacterial or fungal cells are resistant or susceptible to a particular antibiotic. The company detects and identifies pathogens directly from a single patient sample followed by antimicrobial susceptibility testing based on the identification results. The Accelerate PhenoTest BC Kit provides ID and AST results for patients suspected of bacteremia or fungemia, both life-threatening conditions with high morbidity and mortality risk. The Accelerate Pheno system features walk-away automation and consists of a fixed instrument and single-use test kit."
