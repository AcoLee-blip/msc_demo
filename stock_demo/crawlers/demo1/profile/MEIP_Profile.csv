description,"MEI Pharma, Inc. engages in the clinical development of therapies for cancer. The company is headquartered in San Diego, California and currently employs 40 full-time employees. The firm is focused on the clinical development of drugs and therapies for treatment of cancer. The firm's portfolio of clinical drug candidates includes Pracinostat, ME-344 and ME-401. Pracinostat is an orally available histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor indicated for the treatment of hematologic diseases, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). ME-344 is an isoflavone-based mitochondrial inhibitor targeting a mitochondrial component of the terminal respiratory chain complex in rapidly proliferating cells. ME-401 is an oral inhibitor of phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) delta, a molecular target that plays a critical role in the proliferation and survival of hematologic cancer cells. Pracinostat has been tested in multiple Phase I and Phase II clinical trials in advanced hematologic malignancies and solid tumor indications."
