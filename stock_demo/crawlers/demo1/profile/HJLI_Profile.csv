The company is headquartered in Irvine, California and currently employs 9 full-time employees. The firm is developing biologic-based solutions that are designed to be life enhancing for patients with cardiovascular disease, peripheral arterial and venous disease, and end stage renal disease (ESRD). The firm is in the process of developing bioprosthetic implantable devices for cardiovascular disease. The Company’s Bioprosthetic Heart Valve (BHV), is a bioprosthetic, pig heart valve designed to function like a native heart valve, and designed to provide a patient greater functional performance than available devices. The Company’s product Venous Valve is a bioprosthetic, pig venous valve for patients with lower limb chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), which occurs because of damage to the valves of the veins in the legs after patients develop blood clots in the deep venous system."
