The company is headquartered in New York City, New York and currently employs 34 full-time employees. The firm is focused on the discovering and developing of novel gene therapy solutions to treat orphan inherited retinal diseases, with a focus on diseases of the back of the eye. Its primary focus is developing therapeutics for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which is a disorder of the central portion of the retina, known as the macula, that may result in blindness. The Companyâ€™s BEST1 gene encodes a multifunctional protein known as bestrophin1, that regulates ion transport and intracellular calcium signaling in retina cells and helps maintain homeostasis in the sub retinal space between photoreceptors and the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. Its IC-200 is a mutation independent gene therapy, delivered by an AAV2 vector."
