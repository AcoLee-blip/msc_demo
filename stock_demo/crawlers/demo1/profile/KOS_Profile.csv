description,"Kosmos Energy Ltd. engages in the exploration, development, and production of oil and gas. The company is headquartered in Dallas, Texas and currently employs 380 full-time employees. The firm is focused on the emerging areas along the Atlantic Margins. Its assets include existing production and development projects offshore Ghana, Equatorial Guinea and in the United States Gulf of Mexico, discoveries and further exploration potential offshore Mauritania and Senegal, as well as exploration licenses with hydrocarbon potential offshore Sao Tome and Principe, Suriname, Morocco and Western Sahara. The firm has operations in Africa and South America. The West Cape Three Points (WCTP) Block and Deepwater Tano (DT) Block are located within the Tano Basin, offshore Ghana. The Tano Basin represents the eastern extension of the Deep Ivorian Basin, which resulted from the development of an extensional sedimentary basin caused by tensional forces associated with opening of the Atlantic Ocean, as South America separated from Africa in the Mid-Cretaceous period."
