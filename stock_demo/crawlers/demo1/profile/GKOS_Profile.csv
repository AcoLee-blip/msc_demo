description,"Glaukos Corp. is an ophthalmic medical technology and pharmaceutical company, which focuses on novel therapies for the treatment of glaucoma, corneal disorders and retinal diseases. The company is headquartered in San Clemente, California and currently employs 437 full-time employees. The firm focuses on the development and commercialization of products and procedures for the treatment of glaucoma. The company offers iStent, a micro-invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) device. The iStent is a micro-bypass stent inserted through the small corneal incision made during cataract surgery and placed into Schlemm's canal, a circular channel in the eye that collects aqueous humor and delivers it back into the bloodstream. The company is developing three additional pipeline products: the iStent Inject, the iStent Supra and iDose. The iStent Inject includes two stents pre-loaded in an auto-injection inserter. The iStent Supra is designed to access an alternative drainage space within the eye. iDose is a drug delivery system that is designed to be implanted in the eye to continuously deliver therapeutic levels of medication for extended periods of time to lower intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients."
