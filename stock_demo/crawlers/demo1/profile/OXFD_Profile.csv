description,"Oxford Immunotec Global Plc operates as a diagnostics company, which develops and commercializes proprietary tests for immunology and infectious disease. The company is headquartered in Abingdon, Oxfordshire and currently employs 236 full-time employees. The company is focused on developing and commercializing tests for under-served immune-regulated conditions. Its product lines and development activities principally focus on four areas: infectious diseases, transplantation, autoimmune and inflammatory disease and immune-oncology. The company offers a range of assays for tick-borne diseases, such as Lyme disease, obtained through the acquisitions of Imugen and Immunetics. Tick-borne disease is the collective name for diseases passed to humans through the bite of an infected tick. Its diagnostic tests for tick-borne infections include multiple laboratory developed tests (LDTs). Its tick-borne disease tests utilize molecular methods (such as polymerase chain reaction) and techniques to prosecute the immune system. The company has a series of assays for use in blood screening, building upon its expertise in tick-borne disease."
