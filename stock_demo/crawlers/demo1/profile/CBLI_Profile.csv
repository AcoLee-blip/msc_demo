The company is headquartered in Buffalo, New York and currently employs 15 full-time employees. The firm is engaged in developing approaches to activate the immune system and address serious medical needs. Its platform of Toll-like immune receptor activators has applications in mitigation of radiation injury and immuno-oncology. Its advanced product candidate is Entolimod, an immuno-stimulatory agent, which it is developing as a radiation countermeasure and an immunotherapy for oncology and other indications. Its other products include CBLB612, Mobilan and CBL0137. CBLB612 is a compound based upon a natural activator of another tissue-specific component of the innate immune system, the toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)/ toll-like receptor 6 (TLR6) heterodimeric receptor. Mobilan is a recombinant non-replicating adenovirus that directs expression of TLR5 and its agonistic ligand. CBL0137 is a small molecule with a multi-targeted mechanism of action that may be useful for the treatment of various types of cancer."
