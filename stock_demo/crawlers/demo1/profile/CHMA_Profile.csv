description,"Chiasma, Inc. operates as a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, which engages in developing and commercializing oral forms of therapies that are available by injection. The company is headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts and currently employs 18 full-time employees. The firm is engaged in developing and commercializing oral forms of therapies that are available only by injection. Using its Transient Permeability Enhancer (TPE) technology platform, the Company is developing oral therapies. The firm has completed a Phase III clinical trial of its TPE platform-based product candidate, oral octreotide capsules (trade named as MYCAPSSA) for the treatment of acromegaly, a condition that results in the body's production of excess growth hormone. Octreotide is an analog of somatostatin, a natural inhibitor of growth hormone secretion. The firm is developing octreotide capsules as a liquid-filled solid gelatin capsule formulation, which is intended to be taken over twice a day. The firm's TPE technology enhances the absorption through the intestinal wall of drugs. The firm also focuses on developing CH2 for Orphan indication."
