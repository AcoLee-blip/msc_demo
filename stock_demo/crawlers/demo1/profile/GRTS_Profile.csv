description,"Gritstone Oncology, Inc. clinical-stage biotechnology company, which engages in developing the next generation of cancer immunotherapies to fight multiple cancer types. The company is headquartered in Emeryville, California and currently employs 164 full-time employees. The firm focuses to identify and deploy therapeutic neo-antigens from individual patients' tumors to develop treatments for lung cancer. The company provides Gritstone EDGE, which is a tumor-specific neo-antigen (TSNA) prediction platform that predicts the presence of a patient’s TSNA on tumor cells. The company also develops and manufactures a patient-specific therapeutic to direct a robust thymus (T) cell response to those TSNA predicted to be presented on the patient’s tumor. In its GRANITE-001 product candidate each of the viral prime and RNA boost immunizations contain a patient-specific set of predicted TSNA, and the viral prime and RNA boost in its SLATE product candidate series contains a fixed TSNA cassette that is designed for the subset of patients with tumor neoantigens."
