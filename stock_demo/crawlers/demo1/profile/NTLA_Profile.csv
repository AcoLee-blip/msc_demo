description,"Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. engages in the development of gene editing-based therapies. The company is headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts and currently employs 211 full-time employees. The firm is focused on developing therapeutics utilizing a biological tool known as CRISPR/Cas9. The CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system includes two components: the Cas9 protein and the guide RNA sequence. The Cas9 protein acts like a pair of molecular scissors that initiates the natural cellular repair process to knockout, repair or insert a gene. The guide RNA sequence recognizes and directs the Cas9 to a specific target deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence. The firm's sentinel in vivo programs focus on the use of Lipid Nanoparticle (LNPs) for delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 complex to the liver. The firm's division, eXtellia Therapeutics, is focused on the application of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in the fields of immuno-oncology and autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The firm's subsidiary is Intellia Securities Corp. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had not generated any revenue."
